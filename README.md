# Performance Testing with JMeter

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to conduct performance testing using Apache JMeter. The project includes sample test plans, configurations, and results that help understand the fundamentals of load testing web applications and services.

## Features
- **Load Testing**: Simulate multiple users interacting with your application to test its performance under stress.
- **Stress Testing**: Determine how the system behaves under extreme loads.
- **Result Analysis**: Analyze response times, throughput, and error rates.
- **Customizable Test Plans**: Modify existing test plans or create new ones as per requirements.

## Tools Used
- **Apache JMeter**: An open-source software designed to load test functional behavior and measure performance.
- **Java**: Required to run JMeter.
- **Plugins**: JMeter Plugins Manager for extended features (e.g., JSON handling, graphs, etc.).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To get started with performance testing using JMeter, ensure you have the following tools installed:
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- [Apache JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Performance-Testing-with-Jmeter.git
   cd Performance-Testing-with-Jmeter
2. Install Apache JMeter on your local machine.
3. Open the JMeter .jmx test plan files from the test-plans directory in JMeter.
4. Modify the test plan according to your requirements (e.g., updating URLs, setting number of threads)

## Running Tests
1. Open JMeter and load the desired test plan from the test-plans folder.
2. Start the test by clicking the Start button.
3. View the test results in real-time through listeners like Summary Report, View Results in Table, or View Results Tree.
4. Analyze the results based on response time, throughput, and errors.
